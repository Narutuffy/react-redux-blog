React-Router: Updates the react components shown on the screen, depending on the URL
BrowserRouter interacts with the history library and decides what to do based on the change inside URL
Whenever Route has something like 'posts/5' the no. 5 is kind of a wild-card 
If you look at it, routing is just rendering another state of the app (anyway app rerenders itself when state is changed, something like that)
There are different lifecycle method for React. One of them is componentDidMount(). Another on is componentWillMount(), this is before the component mounts itself.
Switch removes the fuziness in the routes behaviour. It maps the exact url from top to bottom
